# Poker-profit-tracker-and-analytics

This project is an exercise in wrangling textual data and constructing a database through which analytics can be performed, demonstrating skills in Python and SQL.

## What this repository contains
#### 1. PokerHistoryFiles
These are the textual accounts of a few of the games that I have played. The usernames of all players have been changed to randomly generated ones.
#### 2. Poker_data
This python file is a module containing functions that I have used to extract the relevant information from each hand.
#### 3. Data cleaning
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how I wrangled and cleaned the data. The resulting csv files are in the folder called "CSV files".
#### 4. Poker game database creation, usage and analytics
Finally, I can compile my database and see my PnL, as well as some other interesting facts about my opponent's play.
